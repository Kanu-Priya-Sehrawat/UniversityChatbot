## Getting Started
Extend template or clone project using following command below:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kanu-Priya-Sehrawat/UniversityChatbot.git
```

Install required dependencies
In a Python3 virtual environment run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To install development dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```
## Operating Commands
Use ``` rasa train ``` to train a model.

Then, to run, first set up your action server in one terminal window:
```sh
rasa run actions
```
In another window, run the duckling server (for entity extraction):
```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling
```
Then to talk to the bot, run:
```sh
rasa shell --debug
```
Note that --debug mode will produce a lot of output meant to help you understand how the bot is working under the hood. You can also add this flag to the action server command. To simply talk to the bot, you can remove this flag.
